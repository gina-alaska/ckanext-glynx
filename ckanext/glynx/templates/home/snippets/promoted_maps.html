		The <a href="{{ /group/all-maps/ }}">Alaska Arctic Map Archive</a> contains field-based geoecological maps and remote-sensing landcover maps that cover areas ranging from the circumpolar Arctic to 1-m2 vegetation plots. Most of the map datasets have been developed using an integrated-terrain-unit-mapping (ITUM) approach. These map datasets each contain numerous map themes that depict a variety of terrain variables (e.g., elevation, vegetation, surficial geomorphology, parent material, substrate pH, glacial geology, landforms, soils, percent water cover, NDVI, plant biomass) along with detailed descriptions and photos of the map-unit types, and literature related to the maps. Not shown on the map above is a key dataset of geoecological maps and classifications of the entire circumpolar Arctic. These datasets have been used in a wide variety of analyses at circumpolar, regional and landscape levels. Other maps in the archive include land-cover classifications using remote-sensing data. The maps which focus on the Toolik Lake and Imnavait Creek region were verified with ground-based transects for landscape-scale maps and with helicopter-based accuracy assessments for regional-scale maps. The AAGA Map Archive is linked to the Vegetation Plot Archive so the locations of the vegetation plots, along with plot photos and other basic dataset information, can be viewed within the context of the GIS-based maps.
